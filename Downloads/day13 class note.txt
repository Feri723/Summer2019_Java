Java Reveiw day: Switch Statement

switch statement:

    whenever you are writing code and checking if some variable equals different values:
            1. you can use multi-branch if
            2. switch statement
        
        switch(Expression){
            case CaseValue :
                    statement1;
                    statement2;
                    break;
            case CaseValue : 
                    statement1;
                    statement2;
                    break;
            default:
                    statement1;
                    statement2;
                    break;
        }
        we can have as many cases as you want
        
        caseValue MUSt match with the switch Expression' dataType

        break statement: 
                used for exiting the switch statement.
                if we don't have break statement, code will continue to run till next break statement or }.
                after the break statement we cannot give any more statements, otherwise compiler will give errors.



        case is similar with else-if.

        default section is similar with else statemnt.

        default section will get executed when there is no case that matches with the given expression.

        default section can be placed any any where with in switch statement.

        in switch statement, none of the blocks( cases and default ) or statements (break;) are mandatory.

    switch statements expression MUSt be evaluate to a single value (either charcaters, digits, or text), therefore 4 dataTypes are not accepted: double, float, long, boolean
                double a = 10L, 10D, 10D;
                float a = 10F, 10f;
                long a = 10, 10L, 10l;
                boolean = true, false, 10 > 9


or logic in switch statement:
        there is no direct way of using || operator
        we can use multiple case blocks back to back.

        char grade ='A';    
            if(grade == 'A' || grade =='B') {               
                System.out.println("Passed the exam");            
            } else {
                System.out.println("Failed"); 
            }
        
            
            switch (grade) {
                case 'A':
                case 'B': 
                    System.out.println("passed the exam");
                    break;
                
                default:
                    System.out.println("failed the exam");
            }
