Topic: Ternary and Scanner 

Ternary:
    
        int num=0;
        if(true){
            num=100.  
        }else{
            num=200;
        }

    converting to ternary:
    
        int num2 = true ? 100 : 200;


        if(condition)      ==> (condition)?
        else               ==>      :
        else if(condition) ==>  :(condition)?

        ternary MUST returns a value, and the value MUST be initialized to a variable or printed out

        total numbers of  ? and : has to be equal.

        in ternary's body we can only give a single value

        () is not required in ternary

Scanner:
    
    Scanner class provides the methods to get user inputs.

    Scanner class is presented in "java.util" package
        in order to use scanner class, first we have to import it:
                    import java.util.Scanner;

        import statement is placed between Package and class name:
                package packageName;

                    import java.util.Scanner;

                public class className {  }


    decleration of Scanner class:

        Scanner variableName = new Scanner(System.in)

        variableName: can reference an object of the scanner class

        new Scanner(System.in): creates scanner class' object

            variableName.nextByte():
                returns the user input as byte value

                byte num = variableName.nextByte();
