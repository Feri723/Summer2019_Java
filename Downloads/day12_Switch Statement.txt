Topic: Reveiw if statement without curly brace, Switch Statement

		Warm up:
			3 numbers, Find out which is largest.
				- if n1 and n2 are equal, => "n1 and n2 are equal"
				- if n2 and n3 are equal=> "n2 and n3 are equal"
				- if n1 and n3 are equal=> "n1 and n3 are equal"
				- if all are equal=> "n1 and n2 and n3 are equal"
				- if none of them are equal => none
		


		if statement without curly braces:

				if by itself without curly brace:

					if(boolean expression)
							// only single line of statement goes here

					without culry bracces, the statment cannot contain more than one statement 



				if and else statement without curly braces:

						if(1st condition)
								// only single line of statement goes here
						else
							// only single line of statement goes here

					without culry bracces, the statment cannot contain more than one statement 




				Multi branch if statements without curly brace:

						if (1st condition)
								// only single line of statement goes here

						else if(2nd condition)
								// only single line of statement goes here

						else 
							// only single line of statement goes here


					without culry bracces, the statment cannot contain more than one statement 




		Switch Statement:

			Switch(Expression){
				case  CaseValue: 
							 statement1;
							 break;

				case  CaseValue2:
						statement1;
						break;
				....

				default:
					some java statement;
					break;
			}

			whichever caseValue is matching with the swith statement's expression, that's the case that will be executed.

			break : used for exiting the switch statement.

			if we don't give the break statement after the case, code will continue running without exiting the switch statement.
			

		switch statement only exits when there is break statement or }
		after break statement we should not give any extra statements because break statement is a closing statement (case closed) any extra statements will give error



	how do we use switch statement:

			Whenever you are writing code and checking if some variable equals different values.
				1) You can use multi branch if statements
				2) Switch statement

					int score=1;
				switch(score){
				case 1:
				System.out.println("score is 1");
				break;
				case 2:
				System.out.println("score is 2");
				break;
				case 3:
				System.out.println("score is 3");
				break;

				}
